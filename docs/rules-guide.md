# Clinical Rules Guide

This document explains how to write clinical decision rules using the s-expression language used in this codebase. Rules are written as Lisp-style s-expressions in `.lisp` files under `s_expression/`. The system compiles these into database queries that run against patient records.

---

## Overview

There are three categories of rule file, each in its own subdirectory:

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `s_expression/tasks/` | Define clinical tasks: what a health worker should check for or do, given some trigger condition |
| `s_expression/system_diagnosis_rules/` | Define automated diagnostic reasoning: given patient evidence, what diagnosis should be assigned and with what certainty |
| `s_expression/system_priority_evaluations/` | Define triage priority: given a diagnosis or condition, what urgency level applies |

Files are named by page number and topic (e.g. `20-anaphylaxis.lisp`). A single file may contain multiple rule expressions.

Comments use Lisp syntax: `;;`.

---

## The Three Rule Types

### 1. Task

A task tells a health worker what to do (check for findings, take measurements, or manage with a treatment) once a trigger condition is met.

```lisp
(task
  "Human-readable description"
  adult                         ;; age group
  <due_to>                      ;; trigger condition (s-expression)
  <action>                      ;; what to do
)
```

**Age groups:** `adult` | `all_ages` (children not yet implemented in apc-adult rules)

**Actions:**

`(check_for ...)` — list findings the health worker should ask about or observe:

```lisp
(check_for
  (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Stiff neck" "finding"))
  (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Difficulty breathing" "finding"))
)
```

`(measure ...)` — a measurement to take:

```lisp
(measure (measurement (snomed_concept "Hemoglobin saturation with oxygen" "observable entity") %))
```

`(manage ...)` — a procedure or drug to administer, optionally gated by role:

```lisp
(manage
  (snomed_concept "Oxygen therapy" "procedure")
)
(manage
  (snomed_concept "Product containing epinephrine" "medicinal product")
  (approved_by (role shcp))
)
```

**Example — task triggered by a diagnosis:**

```lisp
(task
  "Check for urgent fever conditions"
  adult
  (active_condition (snomed_concept "Fever" "finding"))
  (check_for
    (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Stiff neck" "finding"))
    (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Drowsy" "finding"))
  )
)
```

**Example — task triggered by a measurement:**

```lisp
(task
  "Check SpO₂ if respiratory rate >= 15 bpm"
  adult
  (>= (measurement (snomed_concept "Respiratory rate" "observable entity") bpm) 15)
  (measure (measurement (snomed_concept "Hemoglobin saturation with oxygen" "observable entity") %))
)
```

---

### 2. System Diagnosis Rule

A diagnosis rule specifies that when certain patient evidence is present, a particular diagnosis at a particular certainty level should be assigned.

```lisp
(system_diagnosis_rule
  "Human-readable description"
  (diagnosis
    (snomed_concept "Disorder name" "disorder")
    <certainty>
  )
  adult
  <evidence>   ;; s-expression — the logical rule body
)
```

**Certainty levels (most to least certain):** `definite` | `probable` | `equivocal` | `possible` | `improbable`

**Example — simple threshold:**

```lisp
(system_diagnosis_rule
  "Diagnose fever"
  (diagnosis (snomed_concept "Fever" "finding") definite)
  adult
  (>= (measurement (snomed_concept "Body temperature" "observable entity") °C) 38)
)
```

**Example — conjunction of findings and measurement:**

```lisp
(system_diagnosis_rule
  "Diagnose probable hypertensive emergency"
  (diagnosis (snomed_concept "Hypertensive emergency" "disorder") probable)
  adult
  (and
    (or
      (>= (measurement (snomed_concept "Systolic blood pressure" "observable entity") mmHg) 180)
      (>= (measurement (snomed_concept "Diastolic blood pressure" "observable entity") mmHg) 110)
    )
    (or
      (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Headache" "finding"))
      (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Difficulty breathing" "finding"))
    )
  )
)
```

**Example — `any2` (at least 2 of N conditions):**

```lisp
(system_diagnosis_rule
  "Diagnose possible anaphylaxis"
  (diagnosis (snomed_concept "Anaphylaxis" "disorder") possible)
  adult
  (any2
    (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Insect sting" "disorder"))
    (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Itching" "finding"))
    (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Difficulty breathing" "finding"))
    (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Collapse" "finding"))
  )
)
```

Multiple `system_diagnosis_rule` blocks in the same file are independent rules that each run separately.

---

### 3. System Priority Evaluation

Assigns a triage priority level when condition(s) are present.

```lisp
(system_priority_evaluation
  "Human-readable description"
  all_ages
  <priority>
  <condition>
)
```

**Priority levels:** `Emergency` | `Very urgent` | `Urgent`

**Example:**

```lisp
(system_priority_evaluation
  "Urgent: probable anaphylaxis"
  all_ages
  Urgent
  (diagnosis (snomed_concept "Anaphylaxis" "disorder") probable)
)
```

---

## S-Expression Language Reference

### `snomed_concept`

All clinical concepts reference SNOMED CT by name and category:

```lisp
(snomed_concept "Anaphylaxis" "disorder")
(snomed_concept "Systolic blood pressure" "observable entity")
(snomed_concept "Face structure" "body structure")
(snomed_concept "Sudden onset" "qualifier value")
```

**Common categories:** `"finding"` | `"disorder"` | `"observable entity"` | `"body structure"` | `"qualifier value"` | `"morphologic abnormality"` | `"substance"` | `"procedure"` | `"medicinal product"` | `"clinical drug"`

SNOMED concept names are matched against the database. When part of the <due_to> concepts will also matches *descendants* in the SNOMED hierarchy — so querying `"Nasal discharge"` will also match more specific findings like `"Purulent nasal discharge"`.

---

### `clinical_finding`

The most common way to assert that a patient has a clinical observation from this encounter. It is syntactic sugar for a `finding` with `root_snomed_concept = "Clinical finding"`.

```lisp
(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Abdominal pain" "finding"))
```

With a qualifier:

```lisp
(clinical_finding
  (snomed_concept "Swelling" "finding")
  (qualifier (snomed_concept "Sudden onset" "qualifier value"))
)
```

With a `finding_site` attribute:

```lisp
(clinical_finding
  (snomed_concept "Swelling" "finding")
  (finding_site (snomed_concept "Face structure" "body structure"))
  (qualifier (snomed_concept "Sudden onset" "qualifier value"))
)
```

Modifiers can appear in any order. Multiple qualifiers and attributes are all required (AND semantics).

---

### `finding`

The general form, used when you need to express relationships that aren't standard clinical findings. Accepts a root concept, a specific concept, and optional modifiers.

```lisp
(finding
  (snomed_concept "Exposure to (contextual qualifier)" "qualifier value")
  (snomed_concept "Fish" "substance")
)
```

The above matches a patient record where the root concept is "Exposure to…" and the specific concept is "Fish".

---

### `allergy`

Shorthand for an allergic condition with a causative agent. Compiles to a `finding` with:
- root: `Clinical finding`
- specific: `Allergic condition`
- attribute `Causative agent = <substance>`
- `history: true` (searches the patient's full history, not just the current encounter)

```lisp
(allergy (snomed_concept "Fish" "substance"))
(allergy (snomed_concept "Peanut" "substance"))
```

---

### `measurement` and comparison operators

Used to match numeric measurements recorded against a patient.

```lisp
(measurement (snomed_concept "Systolic blood pressure" "observable entity") mmHg)
```

**Available units:** `%` | `bpm` | `°C` | `cm` | `kg` | `mmol/L` | `mmHg` | `mm`

Measurements are used inside comparison expressions:

```lisp
(>= (measurement (snomed_concept "Body temperature" "observable entity") °C) 38)
(<  (measurement (snomed_concept "Systolic blood pressure" "observable entity") mmHg) 90)
(=  (measurement (snomed_concept "Respiratory rate" "observable entity") bpm) 15)
```

Operators: `>` | `<` | `>=` | `<=` | `=`

---

### `diagnosis`

Asserts that a patient has been diagnosed with a condition at a given certainty level. In rule bodies (the `<evidence>` or `due_to` position), this compiles to a query against patient evaluation records.

```lisp
(diagnosis (snomed_concept "Anaphylaxis" "disorder") probable)
(diagnosis (snomed_concept "Fever" "finding") definite)
```

**Certainty levels:** `definite` | `probable` | `equivocal` | `possible` | `improbable`

---

### `active_condition`

Checks whether a condition is currently active for the patient — either as a historical/recorded finding, or as a diagnosis at probable or definite certainty, or as a "Yes" for self-reported status. This is the right expression to use in a task's `due_to` when you want it to fire for patients who have an ongoing condition that has not resolved either from this encounter or past encounters.

```lisp
(active_condition (snomed_concept "Anaphylaxis" "disorder"))
(active_condition (snomed_concept "Fever" "finding"))
```

The optional `possible` modifier widens the check to include possible and equivocal diagnoses:

```lisp
(active_condition (snomed_concept "Anaphylaxis" "disorder") possible)
```

**Compiled expansion** — `(active_condition X)` expands to:

```lisp
(or
  (history (clinical_finding X))
  (history (finding <self-reported-status-attribute> X Yes))
  (diagnosis X probable)
  (diagnosis X definite)
)
```

With `possible`, also includes `(diagnosis X equivocal)` and `(diagnosis X possible)`.

---

### `history`

Wraps a `clinical_finding` or `finding` to search the patient's full history (all encounters), not just the current one. Generally you'd prefer `active_condition` which is more general and uses `history` under the hood.

```lisp
(history (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Asthma" "disorder")))
```

---

### `no`

Wraps a `clinical_finding`, `finding`, or `history` to indicate that there is a negative record corresponding to that concept. The lack of a positive record is not sufficient to trigger a rule looking for `(no)`, the health worker has to have marked "No".

```lisp
(no (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Asthma" "disorder")))
```

---

### Logical operators

**`or`** — at least one child must be satisfied:

```lisp
(or
  (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Headache" "finding"))
  (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Dizziness" "finding"))
)
```

**`and`** — all children must be satisfied:

```lisp
(and
  (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Stiff neck" "finding"))
  (active_condition (snomed_concept "Fever" "finding"))
)
```

**`any2`** — at least 2 of the children must be satisfied:

```lisp
(any2
  (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Insect bite - wound" "disorder"))
  (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Itching" "finding"))
  (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Difficulty breathing" "finding"))
  (clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Collapse" "finding"))
)
```

**`not`** — the child must not be satisfied. Use sparingly; prefer `excluding` on a `finding` for simple exclusion cases.

---

### `qualifier`

Modifies a `clinical_finding` or `finding` by requiring an associated qualifier record (e.g. onset, severity, laterality).

```lisp
(qualifier (snomed_concept "Sudden onset" "qualifier value"))
(qualifier (snomed_concept "Severe (severity modifier)" "qualifier value"))
```

Multiple qualifiers on a finding all need to be present.

---

### `finding_site`

Shorthand attribute specifying anatomical location. Used inside `clinical_finding`:

```lisp
(clinical_finding
  (snomed_concept "Swelling" "finding")
  (finding_site (snomed_concept "Tongue structure" "body structure"))
)
```

This compiles to an `attribute` check. It can be satisfied either by an explicit attribute record on the patient finding, or by SNOMED relationship inference (if the concept's definition already implies the site).

---

### `excluding`

Excludes records that match another expression. Applied directly within a `finding`:

```lisp
(finding
  (snomed_concept "Clinical finding" "finding")
  (snomed_concept "Burn" "disorder")
  (excluding (finding (snomed_concept "Clinical finding" "finding") (snomed_concept "Inhalation burn" "disorder")))
)
```

---

## How the Compiler Translates Expressions to Queries

Understanding how each expression type maps to the database helps when debugging or extending rules.

All queries run against `patient_records_aggregated` — a denormalized table with one row per patient record, indexed for fast lookup. Three of its "subsets" are joined depending on the expression type (see the next section).

### `clinical_finding` / `finding` → `patient_findings`

Compiles to a SELECT from `patient_records_aggregated` INNER JOINed to `patient_findings`, filtered by root/specific SNOMED concept IDs, existence, qualifiers, and attributes.

Non-exact specific concept matches use `snomed_concept_active_descendants_realized` to include descendants.

### `diagnosis` → `patient_evaluations`

`diagnosis` is first converted via `diagnosisToEvaluation` to an `evaluation` node: it queries `patient_evaluations` for an evaluation record whose specific concept matches the diagnosed disorder and whose value concept is the appropriate certainty qualifier (e.g. "probable").

### `evaluation` → `patient_evaluations`

Directly queries `patient_evaluations`. If the evaluation has an `evaluates` clause, it further requires that the evaluation's `evaluates_record_id` points to a record satisfying the inner expression.

### `measurement` → `patient_findings` + `patient_measurements`

Queries records joined to `patient_measurements`, filtered by SNOMED concept and units. Measurement comparisons (e.g. `>=`) apply numeric WHERE clauses on `patient_measurements.value`, accounting for the stored comparator (e.g. a stored `>=` value of 90 satisfies a query for `>= 90`).

### `procedure` → `patient_procedures`

Queries records joined to `patient_procedures`, filtered by specific SNOMED concept.

### `active_condition` → OR expansion

Expanded at query time to an OR of history finding checks plus diagnosis checks at probable/definite certainty (and optionally equivocal/possible if `possible` is set).

### `allergy` → `finding` with attributes

Expanded to a `finding` with root=`Clinical finding`, specific=`Allergic condition`, and a `Causative agent` attribute. The `history: true` flag means it searches all encounters.

---

## `patient_records_aggregated` and Its Three Subsets

`patient_records_aggregated` is a denormalized summary table with one row per patient record. It is populated automatically by a database trigger on INSERT to `patient_records`. Every patient clinical record — regardless of type — lands here.

**Schema highlights:**

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | UUID, same as `patient_records.id` |
| `patient_id` | Patient |
| `patient_encounter_id` | Encounter during which the record was created |
| `root_snomed_concept_id/name/category` | Top-level clinical concept (e.g. "Clinical finding") |
| `specific_snomed_concept_id/name/category` | The specific concept (e.g. "Anaphylaxis") |
| `existence` | `Yes` \| `No` \| `Unknown` |
| `value` | JSONB — type-specific payload (see below) |

The `existence` column is derived from the `value_snomed_concept_id` on the underlying `patient_records` row: the special SNOMED concepts `NO_QUALIFIER` and `UNKNOWN_QUALIFIER` yield `No` and `Unknown`; everything else yields `Yes`.

The `value` JSONB field holds one of: `snomed_concept`, `event`, `measurement`, `score`, `link`, or `task`.

### The Three Subsets

The table itself is undifferentiated, but queries distinguish record type by joining to one of three sub-tables:

**Findings** (`patient_findings`)

Clinical observations: what the patient has or does not have. A finding record may belong to a specific procedure encounter (`procedure_id`). Findings also have a sub-type for measurements (joined via `patient_measurements`) which stores a numeric `value`, `units`, and `comparator`.

```sql
-- conceptually:
patient_records_aggregated
  INNER JOIN patient_findings ON patient_findings.id = patient_records_aggregated.id
```

**Evaluations** (`patient_evaluations`)

Assessment outcomes: diagnoses, scores, and other derived conclusions. An evaluation may reference the record it evaluates via `evaluates_record_id`, and may further have scores in `patient_evaluation_scores`.

```sql
patient_records_aggregated
  INNER JOIN patient_evaluations ON patient_evaluations.id = patient_records_aggregated.id
```

A `diagnosis` expression is always compiled as an evaluation query — the certainty level (probable, definite, etc.) is stored as the `value_snomed_concept` on the evaluation record.

**Procedures** (`patient_procedures`)

Clinical actions that were performed: check_for sessions, administered treatments, ordered measurements. A procedure may have an associated link (`patient_record_links`) or an embedded s-expression (`patient_record_s_expressions`) describing what was done.

```sql
patient_records_aggregated
  INNER JOIN patient_procedures ON patient_procedures.id = patient_records_aggregated.id
```

### Supporting Tables

| Table | Role |
|---|---|
| `patient_record_qualifiers` | Qualifier/attribute records that modify a main record (e.g. "Sudden onset" qualifying "Swelling") |
| `patient_record_relations` | Generic source→destination relationships between records |
| `patient_records_still_valid` | Table with the ids of patient records that haven't been marked as entered in error |
| `snomed_concept_active_descendants_realized` | Pre-computed transitive closure of SNOMED hierarchy, used for ancestor matching |

## Known SNOMED Concepts and Why They Matter for Rules

### How `due_to` makes rules fire

Tasks, diagnosis rules, and priority evaluations only execute when their `due_to` (or `condition`) expression is satisfied by the patient's current records. If the s-expression in `due_to` refers to a concept that is never recorded, the rule never fires — no matter how well the rule body is written.

The most reliable way to ensure a rule fires is to anchor its `due_to` to a concept that the system is already recording for the right patients. Three places in the codebase define the canonical s-expressions for the concepts the system tracks:

---

### `shared/warning_signs.ts` — [WARNING_SIGN_DEFS](https://github.com/Virtual-Hospitals-Africa/virtual-hospitals-africa/blob/4de4ab69e8d8278809383350dc535239b361896d/shared/warning_signs.ts#L133)

Warning signs are the first things recorded for a patient at triage. Each entry has a `clinical_finding_s_expression` — the exact s-expression used to record that finding. Rules that should fire immediately for high-acuity patients must reference these concepts in their `due_to`.

Selected entries:

| Key | `clinical_finding_s_expression` | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `Obstructed airway` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Respiratory obstruction" "disorder"))` | Emergency |
| `Cardiac arrest` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Cardiac arrest" "disorder"))` | Emergency |
| `Seizure` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Seizure" "finding"))` | Emergency |
| `Burn Facial` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Burn of face" "disorder"))` | Emergency |
| `Burn Inhalation` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Inhalation burn due to hot gas" "disorder"))` | Emergency |
| `Acute shortness of breath` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Dyspnea" "finding") (qualifier (snomed_concept "Severe (severity modifier)" "qualifier value")))` | Very urgent |
| `Chest pain` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Chest pain" "finding"))` | Very urgent |
| `Focal neurology` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Cerebrovascular accident" "disorder"))` | Very urgent |
| `Poisoning` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Poisoning" "disorder"))` | Very urgent |
| `Haemorrhage Uncontrolled` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Bleeding" "finding") (qualifier (snomed_concept "Uncontrolled" "qualifier value")))` | Very urgent |
| `Severe pain` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Severe pain" "finding"))` | Very urgent |
| `Vomiting fresh blood` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Vomiting blood - fresh" "disorder"))` | Very urgent |
| `Coughing blood` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Hemoptysis" "finding"))` | Very urgent |
| `Burn Circumferential` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Burn" "disorder") (qualifier (snomed_concept "Circumferential" "qualifier value")))` | Very urgent |

For a task that should fire when a patient arrives with chest pain, the `due_to` should be:

```lisp
(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Chest pain" "finding"))
```

not a paraphrase. The exact concept name must match.

---

### `shared/common_symptoms.ts` — [COMMON_SYMPTOMS](https://github.com/Virtual-Hospitals-Africa/virtual-hospitals-africa/blob/4de4ab69e8d8278809383350dc535239b361896d/shared/common_symptoms.ts#L4)

Common symptoms are the self-reported presenting complaints collected via the chatbot. These are what most APC patients arrive with. Rules for routine conditions (non-emergency) should anchor their `due_to` to these symptoms.

| Key | `clinical_finding_s_expression` |
|---|---|
| `Fever` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Fever" "finding"))` |
| `Cough` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Cough" "finding"))` |
| `Nasal discharge` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Nasal discharge" "finding"))` |
| `Sore throat` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Sore throat" "finding"))` |
| `Headache` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Headache" "finding"))` |
| `Fatigue` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Fatigue" "finding"))` |
| `Dyspnea` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Dyspnea" "finding"))` |
| `Nausea` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Nausea" "finding"))` |
| `Vomiting` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Finding of vomiting" "finding"))` |
| `Diarrhea` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Diarrhea" "finding"))` |
| `Dizziness` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Dizziness" "finding"))` |
| `Muscle pain` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Muscle pain" "finding"))` |
| `Insect bite` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Insect bite - wound" "disorder"))` |
| `Backache` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Backache" "finding"))` |
| `Constipation` | `(clinical_finding (snomed_concept "Constipation" "finding"))` |

The `Fever` task file (`s_expression/tasks/apc-adult/24-fever.lisp`) is a good example: it uses `(active_condition (snomed_concept "Fever" "finding"))` in `due_to`, matching exactly the concept recorded by the common symptom.

---

### `shared/snomed_concepts.ts` — [source](shared/snomed_concepts.ts)

This file defines named TypeScript constants for all SNOMED concepts that have special meaning somewhere in the rest of the application. 

**Vital sign observables** (use in `measurement`):

|---|---|---|
| `BODY_TEMPERATURE` | `"Body temperature"` | `"observable entity"` |
| `SYSTOLIC_BLOOD_PRESSURE` | `"Systolic blood pressure"` | `"observable entity"` |
| `DIASTOLIC_BLOOD_PRESSURE` | `"Diastolic blood pressure"` | `"observable entity"` |
| `HEMOGLOBIN_SATURATION_WITH_OXYGEN` | `"Hemoglobin saturation with oxygen"` | `"observable entity"` |
| `RESPIRATORY_RATE` | `"Respiratory rate"` | `"observable entity"` |
| `PULSE_FUNCTION` | `"Pulse, function"` | `"observable entity"` |
| `BLOOD_GLUCOSE_STATUS` | `"Blood glucose status"` | `"observable entity"` |

**Common chronic conditions** (use with `active_condition` or `diagnosis`):

| Constant | Name | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `DIABETES_MELLITUS` | `"Diabetes mellitus"` | `"disorder"` |
| `TUBERCULOSIS` | `"Tuberculosis"` | `"disorder"` |
| `HUMAN_IMMUNODEFICIENCY_VIRUS_INFECTION` | `"Human immunodeficiency virus infection"` | `"disorder"` |

## Tips for Writing Rules

- **Use `active_condition` in task `due_to` for ongoing conditions** — it checks history and diagnosis. Use raw `clinical_finding` only when you specifically mean a finding in the current encounter.
- **Prefer `clinical_finding` over `finding`** — `clinical_finding` is clearer and covers the vast majority of cases.
- **Use `allergy` for substance allergies** — don't try to hand-write the equivalent `finding`; `allergy` is the canonical form and will keep the compiled query correct.
- **Anchor `due_to` to recorded concepts** — check `WARNING_SIGN_DEFS`, `COMMON_SYMPTOMS`, and `shared/snomed_concepts.ts` first. If your trigger concept isn't in one of those, the rule may never fire in practice.
- **Add `;;` comments** to explain clinical rationale, especially for non-obvious thresholds or `any2` counts.
- **File naming convention** — match the page number from the clinical protocol and use a descriptive slug: `132-hypertension.lisp`.
- **Multiple rules per file are fine** — tasks and diagnosis rules that belong to the same clinical topic can coexist in one file.
- **Test SNOMED names against the database** — concept names are matched exactly (case-sensitive). Run `deno task test ./test/shared/compiled_s_expressions.test.ts` to validate all concepts in `.lisp` files exist in the database.
